# Othello Engine in Rust 🦀
A small, fast, and modular Othello (Reversi) engine written in Rust. Built as a learning project to explore the language.

## 🚀 Features (Planned & In Progress)
- 🧠 **Multiple difficulty levels** (different ELO-rated engines)
- 🧮 **Position evaluation** to visualize game states
- ♟️ Core game logic with move generation, legality checks, and win conditions

## 🛠️ Why?
This project started as a hands-on way to:
- Learn Rust through a real-world game engine
- Explore algorithms for board evaluation and AI difficulty scaling
- Prepare for building a more complex chess engine in Rust
